title: "Updating Kitchen Information Architecture"

contextCompany: "I live in a third-generation collective with three other people, where we share common areas like the kitchen."

contextProblem: "Our kitchen was organised by people that no longer were living in the collective. Their system was ineffective and illogical, and we were not unlocking the full potential of our kitchen"

contextRole: "I was growing increasingly frustrated with the inefficiency of the kitchen, but then it dawned on me: how you organize a kitchen is nothing different from ordering the information architecture of a website or an app. That is exactly what I do professionally, so why shouldn't I utilize my skills at home as well?"

process: "I made a list of the items we had in the kitchen. I added that list to Notion.io, where I utilized their card function for a digital, open card sort with my roommates and myself. I imported the data to Python where I coded automatic data analysis. I used some extra time to make the analysis generic, so the code can be reused whenever I need to make a new card sort.

I took the findings from the data analysis and started prototyping the new kitchen IA using post-it notes. This was a quick and easy way of trying out different arrangements. 

Over the months I have collected quotes from my roommates about their frustrations using the kitchen. I used these while rearranging. For instance, the pots and pans where one big unorganized pile in a deep cupboard. In the final solution pots and pans were separated in two drawers where the access is much better.

I also kept use cases in mind. For instance, brewing a cup of coffee is easier if I keep the mugs, coffee beans, coffee grinder, funnel and filters close to each other."

solution: "After rearranging the kitchen I and my roommates started using the kitchen in our everyday. Except for the initial 'getting-use-to', a few things had to be rearranged due to unforeseen consequences. Mainly the bio bucket was moved away from the other recycling bins and closer to the zink. We did this to avoid dripping on the floor when emptying out the zink from food scraps. But other than that everyone were pleased."

result: "We are now using all the cupboards and drawers. Things that are similar or often used together are placed close to each other. Workflows are improved since items are now strategically placed. The current residents now have higher ownership of the kitchen."

challenges: "Since we are only 4 people living in the collective, the 'quantitative' data collected from the card sort was naturally limited, but again it is mainly the 4 of us who use the kitchen and therefore a good user representation."

takeAways: "Making the quick prototypes of post-it notes made iterations super quick. It took everything from your head and placed it in the real world where it belonged. 

Furthermore, it is super valuable to keep monitoring a solution after it is launched since there is still a lot to be learned."
