contextCompany: "InnoAid is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation that was founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in January 2008 by a group of young passionate people within design engineering, medicine and pharmacy. They all shared a common interest in taking action in addressing development challenges by using their academic skills."

contextProblem: "Street kitchens plays a vital economical and cultural role in modern India. However, since street vending officially has been illegal up until recently, street kitchens have had little to no regulations. New regulations, which among other things, concern public health will challenge a large number of the street vendors and in worst case force them to close. InnoAid sought to investigate potential solutions for improving hand hygiene at indian street kitchens in Kolkata in order to improve local health and help the local street vendors stay open."

contextRole: "My thesis partner and I were the lead responsibles on the area of hand hygiene. We wrote our thesis with the help of InnoAid's staff in Copenhagen and their office in Kolkata. They helped with setting up interviews in India as well as providing translators and guiding. "

process: "We did 5 weeks of Contextual Inquiries in Kolkata, India, to better understand the problem space. On the basis of that we conceptualised several possible hand wash solutions, we narrowed those down to a single concept, which we prototyped."

solution: "We arrived at a durable, affordable solution that could be built by local blacksmiths. It was important the final solution would improve hand hygiene, but still not too radical from existing solutions. This was important to lower the barrier to entry, and actually ensure that the customers of the street kitchens will wash their hands."

result: "Our findings, design work and prototype was handed over to InnoAid, and they will use that in their further work. "

challenges: "It was difficult to predict the behaviour of our target users because our lives and cultures were so different. It was therefore important for me to put aside any assumptions and outcome predictions I might have had and focus on doing proper research.

Our biggest challenge was that we only had one trip to India. It would have been super valuable to have at least a second trip to validate our concept, but it was not possible due to time and budget constraints. We tried to mitigate this by remote user involvement using videos and online questionnaires."

takeAways: "If I didn't know it before, then I do know it now; what people say they do is seldom the same as what they actually do.

Try to put aside assumptions, do proper research and find clever ways of testing assumptions and ideas whenever possible."
