contextCompany: "Tame provides event planning software for event organizers of mostly bigger events (think multiple speakers, days and stages). Through Tame's software you can gradually plan and enter information about the event, and when you are ready; you can press a button and generate a website, through which you can promote the event and sell tickets."


contextProblem: "Tame had originally built a feature for event planners to reuse data between their events. The idea was good, however, we kept receiving bug complaints from our users using this feature, even though everything was working as intended. We hypothesized that the feature did not match the users' mental model and the lack of feedback from the system made it impossible for the users to realize what was actually happening. "


contextRole: "I was the only UX specialist in the company, but I worked closely with the digital designer and the development team. I was the instigator of this project since I gleaned frustration from several of our users. My responsibilities in this project included exploration of the problem space, generation of the new information architecture, collaboration with the designer to create prototypes and of course to do tests on each step of the way."

process: "Think-out-loud user testing showed that the mental models of our users far from matched how the product actually worked. I compiled and analyzed the findings through a user journey map that I used to validate my understanding by showing it to the users from the tests. I also used it to communicate the problem with other stakeholders of the company and in the project. With the user journey map as a foundation, I created a User Story Map. From this, the digital designer and I ideated several possible solutions that were quickly mocked up in paper prototypes and tested on stakeholders. With the findings from here, we chose the best solution, iterated on it. I then created an annotated user storyboard, meanwhile, the designer designed the screens."

solution: "Our final solution was radical, yet elegant. We simplified the information architecture and added feedback for tranparency. All this aligned our product with users' presumptions and mental models."

result: "The transparency helped our users to understand what was happening, the simplified IA made the feature more intuitive and in turn improved onboarding of new users and lowered the frustration of existing users. Since we worked in close collaboration with the engineering department, we assured it wouldn't take long to develop."

challenges: "My employment stopped before the feature was fully developped. Therefore, I can only share what we learned through prototyping."

takeAways: "Continuously listen to the users of the product. Do not be afraid of challenging status quo!"
